Just over 13 million hectares of old growth forest remains today in BC and make up around 23% of all forested areas in the province. Our project will go in one of two possible directions: studying old growth forests in BC and modelling and predicting their decay; or, investigating the sustainability and environmental effects of overfishing and fish farming in coastal BC.

British Columbia’s old growth forests are a collapsing ecosystem with historical and current significance to the Indigenous Peoples of the region. Despite old growth forests pulling carbon from the atmosphere at a slower rate than young forests, their carbon stores are immense. When older forests are logged, much of this carbon is released into the atmosphere.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.
