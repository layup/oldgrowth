# oldgrowthcarbonemissions
British Columbia’s old growth forests are a collapsing ecosystem with historical and current significance to the Indigenous Peoples of the region. Despite old growth forests pulling carbon from the atmosphere at a slower rate than young forests, their carbon stores are immense. When older forests are logged, much of this carbon is released into the atmosphere. Secondly, the Western Pine Beetle is ravaging BC’s forests. Due to a warming climate, our winters have not reached low enough temperatures to balance the beetle population allowing them to turn our forests into fodder for wildfires.
