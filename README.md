Just over 13 million hectares of old growth forest remains today in BC and make up around 23% of all forested areas in the province. Our project will go in one of two possible directions: studying old growth forests in BC and modelling and predicting their decay; or, investigating the sustainability and environmental effects of overfishing and fish farming in coastal BC.

British Columbia’s old growth forests are a collapsing ecosystem with historical and current significance to the Indigenous Peoples of the region. Despite old growth forests pulling carbon from the atmosphere at a slower rate than young forests, their carbon stores are immense. When older forests are logged, much of this carbon is released into the atmosphere.

I haven't bailed on writing. Look, I'm generating a random paragraph at this very moment in an attempt to get my writing back on track. I am making an effort. I will start writing consistently again!

It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand,**Italics** the choice seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice. The safe choice[url title](http://<url>). But she wasn't sure she actually preferred it.

But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
[Longe and Parole](http://google.com) and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.

## Data Collection 

The Vegetation Resource Inventory (VRI) 

| VRI Data name      | Data Description  |
| :-----             | :---| 
| Tree Species       | A list of the minor and major tree species in a given layer ordered by percentage | 
| Tree Cover Pattern | A numeric code that identifies the spatial distribution of the tree layer  | 
| Forest Cover Age Class | The age class projected to the current year for a given species based on area  | 
| Land Cover           | Identities a type of land cover  | 
| Disturbance History  | Describe how an area became this way, we can use it to determine if this area has been logged and what percentage of this area has been logged  |

## Old Growth Carbon Emissions Calculator  


We are generating an overall carbon emission report that is calculated using Sentienel-2 and VRI data.To calculate our carbon emissions report for a given test site we first need to calculate how much carbon a certain species of tree (ST) can capture in their lifetime. Afterwards, we need to determine the average age of that tree species (AT), the percentage that this given species of tree occupies (PT). All this information is provided to us from the VRI dataset. From here determine all the other tree species (TS) and the overall area. 

(PT x ST x AT) x TS x Area 

ST =  Species of tree
AT =  Average age of tree species
PT = Percentage tree species occupies
TS =  All other tree species
